Hi, thank you for coming to my repo!
You probably meant to go to one of these projects instead:

| Project | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
|[adyanth/cloudflare-operator](https://github.com/adyanth/cloudflare-operator)|A Kubernetes Operator to create and manage Cloudflare Tunnels and DNS records for (HTTP/TCP/UDP*) Service Resources|
|[STRRL/cloudflare-tunnel-ingress-controller](https://github.com/STRRL/cloudflare-tunnel-ingress-controller/)|The Kuberntes Ingress Controller based on Cloudflare Tunnel.|

Both projects are much more mature and can probably do what you're looking for!

# Cloudflare Controller

A kubernetes controller for all things Cloudflare!

## Rationale

There are two great projects bringing cloudflare to kubernetes, what is this project trying to add?

I love what the above projects can do and I wanted to take my favorite parts and put them in one place.
Ultimately, I'm trying to get more experience writing kubernetes applications and this seemed like a great way to do it.
